**1. Storymap Library**

A story map is a strategy that uses a graphic organizer to learn the elements of a story. By identifying story characters, plot, setting, problem and solution, users can read carefully to learn the details.

This storymap uses Storymap.js -- a story map telling library at https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap. Using this library, you can create a map that follows a storyline. For each paragraph, you can place a map alongside it, and manipulate the map by zooming, panning, and even adding more thematic layers. This map library follows the concept responsive design, meaning the stories can be shown on any Desktop or mobile device.
